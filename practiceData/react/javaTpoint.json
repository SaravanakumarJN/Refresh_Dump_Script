      "statement": "What is React?",
      "explanation": "React is a declarative, efficient, flexible open source front-end JavaScript library developed by Facebook in 2011. It follows the component-based approach for building reusable UI components, especially for single page application. It is used for developing interactive view layer of web and mobile apps. It was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. It was initially deployed on Facebook's News Feed section in 2011 and later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram.\n\n"

      "explanation": "The limitations of React are:\n\n*   The high pace of development\n*   Poor Documentation\n*   View Part\n*   JSX as a barrier\n\n"
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What is JSX?",
      "explanation": "JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a React extension which allows writing JavaScript code that looks similar to HTML. It makes HTML file easy to understand. The JSX file makes the React application robust and boosts its performance. JSX provides you to write XML-like syntax in the same file where you write JavaScript code, and then preprocessor (i.e., transpilers like Babel) transform these expressions into actual JavaScript code. Just like XML/HTML, JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children.\n\n**Example**\n\n    class App extends React.Component {\n      render() {\n        return(\n          <div>\n            <h1>Hello JavaTpoint</h1>\n          </div>\n        )\n      }\n    }\n    \n\nIn the above example, text inside <h1> tag return as JavaScript function to the render function. After compilation, the JSX expression becomes a normal JavaScript function, as shown below.\n\n    React.createElement(\"h1\", null, \"Hello JavaTpoint\");\n    \n\n"
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "Why can't browsers read JSX?",
      "explanation": "Browsers cannot read JSX directly because they can only understand JavaScript objects, and JSX is not a regular JavaScript object. Thus, we need to transform the JSX file into a JavaScript object using transpilers like Babel and then pass it to the browser."
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "Why we use JSX?",
      "explanation": "*   It is faster than regular JavaScript because it performs optimization while translating the code to JavaScript.\n*   Instead of separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React uses components that contain both.\n*   t is type-safe, and most of the errors can be found at compilation time.\n*   It makes easier to create templates."

      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What do you understand by Virtual DOM?",
      "explanation": "A Virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript object which is an in-memory representation of real DOM. It is an intermediary step between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. It is similar to a node tree which lists the elements, their attributes, and content as objects and their properties. The render function creates a node tree of the React components and then updates this node tree in response to the mutations in the data model caused by various actions done by the user or by the system."
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "Explain the working of Virtual DOM.",
      "explanation": "Virtual DOM works in three steps:\n\n1\\. Whenever any data changes in the React App, the entire UI is re-rendered in Virtual DOM representation.\n\n2\\. Now, the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new DOM is calculated.\n\n3\\. Once the calculations are completed, the real DOM updated with only those things which are changed."

      "statement": "What do you understand from \"In React, everything is a component.\"",
      "explanation": "In React, components are the building blocks of React applications. These components divide the entire React application's UI into small, independent, and reusable pieces of code. React renders each of these components independently without affecting the rest of the application UI. Hence, we can say that, in React, everything is a component."
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "Explain the purpose of render(",
      "explanation": "It is mandatory for each React component to have a render() function. Render function is used to return the HTML which you want to display in a component. If you need to rendered more than one HTML element, you need to grouped together inside single enclosing tag (parent tag) such as <div>, <form>, <group> etc. This function returns the same result each time it is invoked.\n\n**Example:** If you need to display a heading, you can do this as below.\n\n    import React from 'react'\n     \n    class App extends React.Component {\n       render (){\n          return (\n             <h1>Hello World</h1>\n          )\n       }\n    }\n    export default App\n    \n\n**Points to Note:**\n\n*   Each render() function contains a return statement.\n*   The return statement can have only one parent HTML tag."

      "statement": "What is Props?",
      "explanation": "Props stand for \"Properties\" in React. They are read-only inputs to components. Props are an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTML attributes. It gives a way to pass data from the parent to the child components throughout the application.\n\nIt is similar to function arguments and passed to the component in the same way as arguments passed in a function.\n\nProps are immutable so we cannot modify the props from inside the component. Inside the components, we can add attributes called props. These attributes are available in the component as this.props and can be used to render dynamic data in our render method.\n\n"

      "explanation": "The State is an updatable structure which holds the data and information about the component. It may be changed over the lifetime of the component in response to user action or system event. It is the heart of the react component which determines the behavior of the component and how it will render. It must be kept as simple as possible.\n\nLet's create a \"User\" component with \"message state.\"\n\n    import React from 'react'\n    \n    class User extends React.Component {\n      constructor(props) {\n        super(props)\n    \n        this.state = {\n          message: 'Welcome to JavaTpoint'\n        }\n      }\n    \n      render() {\n        return (\n          <div>\n            <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>\n          </div>\n        )\n      }\n    }\n    export default User\n    \n\n"

Forms can perform many tasks such as user authentication, adding user, searching, filtering, etc. A form can contain text fields, buttons, checkbox, radio button, etc.\n\nReact offers a stateful, reactive approach to build a form. The forms in React are similar to HTML forms. But in React, the state property of the component is only updated via setState(), and a JavaScript function handles their submission. This function has full access to the data which is entered by the user into a form.\n\n    import React, { Component } from 'react';\n    \n    class App extends React.Component {\n      constructor(props) {\n          super(props);\n          this.state = {value: ''};\n          this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n          this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);\n      }\n      handleChange(event) {\n          this.setState({value: event.target.value});\n      }\n      handleSubmit(event) {\n          alert('You have submitted the input successfully: ' + this.state.value);\n          event.preventDefault();\n      }\n      render() {\n          return (\n              <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>\n                <h1>Controlled Form Example</h1>\n                <label>\n                    Name:\n                    <input type=\"text\" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />\n                </label>\n                <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" />\n             </form>\n          );\n      }\n    }\n    export default App;\n    \n\n"

      "explanation": "The different phases of React component's lifecycle are:\n\n**Initial Phase:** It is the birth phase of the React lifecycle when the component starts its journey on a way to the DOM. In this phase, a component contains the default Props and initial State. These default properties are done in the constructor of a component.\n\n**Mounting Phase:** In this phase, the instance of a component is created and added into the DOM.\n\n**Updating Phase:** It is the next phase of the React lifecycle. In this phase, we get new Props and change State. This phase can potentially update and re-render only when a prop or state change occurs. The main aim of this phase is to ensure that the component is displaying the latest version of itself. This phase repeats again and again.\n\n**Unmounting Phase:** It is the final phase of the React lifecycle, where the component instance is destroyed and unmounted(removed) from the DOM.\n\n"

      "explanation": "The important React lifecycle methods are:\n\n*   **getInitialState():** It is used to specify the default value of this.state. It is executed before the creation of the component.\n*   **componentWillMount():** It is executed before a component gets rendered into the DOM.\n*   **componentDidMount():** It is executed when the component gets rendered and placed on the DOM. Now, you can do any DOM querying operations.\n*   **componentWillReceiveProps():** It is invoked when a component receives new props from the parent class and before another render is called. If you want to update the State in response to prop changes, you should compare this.props and nextProps to perform State transition by using this.setState() method.\n*   **shouldComponentUpdate():** It is invoked when a component decides any changes/updation to the DOM and returns true or false value based on certain conditions. If this method returns true, the component will update. Otherwise, the component will skip the updating.\n*   **componentWillUpdate():** It is invoked before rendering takes place in the DOM. Here, you can't change the component State by invoking this.setState() method. It will not be called, if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.\n*   **componentDidUpdate():** It is invoked immediately after rendering takes place. In this method, you can put any code inside this which you want to execute once the updating occurs.\n*   **componentWillUnmount():** It is invoked immediately before a component is destroyed and unmounted permanently. It is used to clear up the memory spaces such as invalidating timers, event listener, canceling network requests, or cleaning up DOM elements. If a component instance is unmounted, you cannot mount it again.\n\n"
