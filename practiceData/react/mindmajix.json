      "statement": "What is React?",
      "explanation": "React is a front-end JavaScript library that mainly follows the component-based approach for building a user interface (UI) components for a single page application. It is also used for handling the view layer in both mobile and web apps. Moreover, react plays a crucial role in developing interactive mobile and web UIs. It was created and developed by Jordan Walke; it was deployed first on the Facebook newsfeed in 2011."

      "statement": "How React works?",
      "explanation": "Below is the sequence of steps which gives an idea about how does react work\n\n*   Firstly the react runs the diffing algorithm to identify the changes that are made in the virtual DOM.\n*   Next step is reconciliation, this is used to update the DOM as per the new features.\n*   Now, the virtual DOM, which is lightweight in nature and is detached from the specific implementation of the browser.\n*   Followingly the ReactElements which are present in virtual DOM are used to build basic nodes.\n*   Finally, if the ReactComponent changes the state; the diffing algorithm runs faster and identify the changes. After identification, it automatically updates the DOM with the change difference."

      "explanation": "The first difference between both of them is their code dependency. ReactJS depends less on the code whereas AngularJS needs a lot of coding to be done. The packaging on React is quite strong as compared to the AngularJS. Another difference is React is equipped with Virtual Dom while the Angular has a Regular DOM. ReactJS is all about the components whereas AngularJS focus mainly on the Models, View as well as on Controllers. AngularJS was developed by Google while the ReactJS is the outcome of facebook. These are some of the common differences between the two."

      "explanation": "Redux thunk acts as middleware which allows an individual to write action creators that return functions instead of actions. This is also used as a delay function in order to delay dispatch of an action if a certain condition is met. The two store methods _getState()_ and _dispatch()_ are provided as parameters to the inner function.\n\nIn order to activate Redux thunk, we must first use applyMiddleware() method as shown below:\n\n    import{ createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';\n    import thunk from 'redux-thunk';\n    import rootReducer from './reducers/index';\n    \n    //Note: this API requires redux@>=3.1.0\n    \n    const store= createStore(\n         rootReducer,\n         applyMiddleware(thunk)\n    );"

      "explanation": "Yes, there are a few drawbacks which are associated with this platform. The leading drawback of the ReactJS is the size of its library. It is very complex and creates a lot of confusion among the developers. Also, there are lots of developers all over the world which really don’t like the JSX and inline templating. In addition to this, there is another major limitation of ReactJS and i.e. only cover one layer of the app and i.e.View. Thus to manage the development, developers have to depend on several other technologies which consume time."

      "statement": "In which lifecycle event do you make AJAX requests and why?",
      "explanation": "AJAX solicitations ought to go in the **componentDidMount** lifecycle event.   \nThere are a couple of reasons behind this, \n\nFiber, the following usage of React's reconciliation algorithm, will be able to begin and quit rendering as required for execution benefits. One of the exchange offs of this is **componentWillMount**, the other lifecycle event where it may bode well to influence an AJAX to ask for, will be \"non-deterministic\". This means React may begin calling **componentWillMount** at different circumstances at whenever point it senses that it needs to. This would clearly be a bad formula for AJAX requests. \n\nYou can't ensure the AJAX request won't resolve before the component mounts. In the event that it did, that would imply that you'd be attempting to setState on an unmounted component, which won't work, as well as React will holler at you for. Doing AJAX in componentDidMount will ensure that there's a component to update."

However, you can use you are free to use the word “ClassName”. If you use the word “Class” the JSX will be translated to JavaScript immediately.\n\n##### **a) High-Level Component Lifecycle:**\n\nAt the highest level, React components have lifecycle events that fall into 3 general classifications: \n\n1.  Initialization\n2.  State/Property Updates\n3.  Destruction\n\nEach React component defines these events as a system for dealing with its properties, state, and rendered output. Some of these events just happen once, others happen more as often as possible; understanding these 3 general classes should help you clearly visualize when certain logic required to be applied.\n\nFor instance, a component may need to add an event audience to the DOM when it initially mounts. In any case, it ought to likely expel those event listeners when the component unmounts from the DOM with the goal that not relevant handling that doesn't occur.\n\n    class MyComponent extends React.Component{\n       //when the component is added to the DOM...\n    componentDidMount(){\n    window.addEventListener('resize',this.onResizeHandler);\n    }\n    //when the component is removed from the DOM...\n    componentWillmount(){\n    window.addEventListener('resize',this.onResizeHandler);\n    }\n    \n    onResizeHandler(){\n    console.log('The window has been resized!');\n    }\n    }\n    \n\n**b) Low-Level Component Lifecycle:**\n\nInside these 3 general buckets exist various particular lifecycle hooks — basically unique techniques - that can be used by any React component to all the more precisely manage updates. Seeing how and when these hooks fire is vital to building stable components and will empower you to control the rendering procedure (enhancing execution). \n\nObserve the diagram above. The events under \"Initialization\" just happen when a component is first initialized or added to the DOM. Thus, the events under \"Devastation\" just happen once (when the component is expelled from the DOM). However, the events under \"Update\" happen each time the properties or state of the component change. \n\nFor instance, components will naturally re-render themselves whenever their properties or state change. However, at times a component should not update - so keeping the component from re-rendering may enhance the execution of our application.\n\n    class MyComponent extends React.Component{\n        //only re-render if the ID has changed!\n        shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState;\n        }\n    }"

      "statement": "Compare Flux vs MVC",
      "explanation": "Conventional MVC designs have functioned admirably to separate the worries of data (Model), UI (View) and logic (Controller) — however many web engineers have found impediments with that approach as applications develop in measure. In particular, MVC architectures as often as possible experience 2 primary issues:\n\n_**Ineffectively defined data flow:**_ The cascading updates which happen crosswise over perspectives frequently prompt a tangled web of events which is hard to debug. \n\n_**Lack of data integrity:**_ Model data can be changed from anyplace, yielding erratic results over the UI.\n\nWith the Flux pattern complex, UIs never again experience the ill effects of cascading updates; any given React component will have the capacity to recreate its state in light of the information given by the store. The flux pattern likewise upholds data integrity by limiting direct access to the shared data.\n\nWhile a technical interview, it is awesome to talk about the contrasts between the Flux and MVC configuration designs inside the setting of a particular illustration: \n\nFor instance, imagine we have a \"master/detail\" UI in which the client can choose a record from a rundown (master view) and alter it utilizing an auto-populated form (detail view). \n\nWith a MVC architecture, the data contained inside the Model is shared between both the master and detail views. Each of these perspectives may have its own particular Controller assigning updates between the Model and the View. Anytime the information contained inside the Model may be updated — and it's hard to know where precisely that change happened. Did it occur in one of the Views sharing that Model, or in one of the Controllers? Since the Model's information can be transformed by any performing artist in the application, the danger of information contamination in complex UIs is more prominent than we'd like. \n\nWith a Flux architecture, the Store data is correspondingly shared between different Views. However this data can't be straightforwardly changed — the greater part of the solicitations to update the data must go through the Action > Dispatcher chain first, eliminating the risk of arbitrary data pollution. At the point when refreshes are made to the data, it's presently significantly less demanding to find the code requesting for those progressions."
