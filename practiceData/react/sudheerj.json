      "statement": "What is React?",
      "explanation": "React is an **open-source frontend JavaScript library** which is used for building user interfaces especially for single page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012."

      "statement": "What are the major features of React?",
      "explanation": "The major features of React are:\n\n*   It uses **VirtualDOM** instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.\n*   Supports **server-side rendering**.\n*   Follows **Unidirectional** data flow or data binding.\n*   Uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view."

      "statement": "What is JSX?",
      "explanation": "_JSX_ is a XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript (the acronym stands for _JavaScript XML_). Basically it just provides syntactic sugar for the `React.createElement()` function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.\n\nIn the example below text inside `<h1>` tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.\n\n    class App extends React.Component {\n      render() {\n        return (\n          <div>\n            <h1>{\"Welcome to React world!\"}</h1>\n          </div>\n        );\n      }\n    }"
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What is the difference between Element and Component?",
      "explanation": "An _Element_ is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. _Elements_ can contain other _Elements_ in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it is never mutated.\n\nThe object representation of React Element would be as follows:\n\n    const element = React.createElement(\"div\", { id: \"login-btn\" }, \"Login\");\n    \n\nThe above `React.createElement()` function returns an object:\n\n    {\n      type: 'div',\n      props: {\n        children: 'Login',\n        id: 'login-btn'\n      }\n    }\n    \n\nAnd finally it renders to the DOM using `ReactDOM.render()`:\n\n    <div id=\"login-btn\">Login</div>\n    \n\nWhereas a **component** can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a `render()` method. Alternatively, in simple cases, it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns a JSX tree as the output:\n\n    const Button = ({ onLogin }) => (\n      <div id={\"login-btn\"} onClick={onLogin}>\n        Login\n      </div>\n    );\n    \n\nThen JSX gets transpiled to a `React.createElement()` function tree:\n\n    const Button = ({ onLogin }) =>\n      React.createElement(\n        \"div\",\n        { id: \"login-btn\", onClick: onLogin },\n        \"Login\"\n      );"
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "How to create components in React?",
      "explanation": "There are two possible ways to create a component.\n\n1.  **Function Components:** This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as first parameter and return React elements:\n    \n        function Greeting({ message }) {\n          return <h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}</h1>;\n        }\n        \n    \n2.  **Class Components:** You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as:\n    \n        class Greeting extends React.Component {\n          render() {\n            return <h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}</h1>;\n          }\n        }"
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?",
      "explanation": "If the component needs _state or lifecycle methods_ then use class component otherwise use function component. _However, from React 16.8 with the addition of Hooks, you could use state , lifecycle methods and other features that were only available in class component right in your function component._"
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What are Pure Components?",
      "explanation": "_`React.PureComponent`_ is exactly the same as _`React.Component`_ except that it handles the `shouldComponentUpdate()` method for you. When props or state changes, _PureComponent_ will do a shallow comparison on both props and state. _Component_ on the other hand won't compare current props and state to next out of the box. Thus, the component will re-render by default whenever `shouldComponentUpdate` is called."
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What is state in React?",
      "explanation": "_State_ of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.\n\nLet's create an user component with message state,\n\n    class User extends React.Component {\n      constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n    \n        this.state = {\n          message: \"Welcome to React world\",\n        };\n      }\n    \n      render() {\n        return (\n          <div>\n            <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>\n          </div>\n        );\n      }\n    }\n    \n\nState is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component. i.e, It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it."
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What are props in React?",
      "explanation": "_Props_ are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.\n\nThe primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:\n\n1.  Pass custom data to your component.\n2.  Trigger state changes.\n3.  Use via `this.props.reactProp` inside component's `render()` method.\n\nFor example, let us create an element with `reactProp` property:\n\n    <Element reactProp={\"1\"} />\n    \n\nThis `reactProp` (or whatever you came up with) name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.\n\n    props.reactProp"
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What is the difference between state and props?",
      "explanation": "Both _props_ and _state_ are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to component. Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters whereas state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function."
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "Why should we not update the state directly?",
      "explanation": "If you try to update state directly then it won't re-render the component.\n\n    //Wrong\n    this.state.message = \"Hello world\";\n    \n\nInstead use `setState()` method. It schedules an update to a component's state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.\n\n    //Correct\n    this.setState({ message: \"Hello World\" });\n    \n\n**Note:** You can directly assign to the state object either in _constructor_ or using latest javascript's class field declaration syntax."
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of `setState()`?",
      "explanation": "The callback function is invoked when setState finished and the component gets rendered. Since `setState()` is **asynchronous** the callback function is used for any post action.\n\n**Note:** It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather than this callback function.\n\n    setState({ name: \"John\" }, () =>\n      console.log(\"The name has updated and component re-rendered\")\n    );"
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?",
      "explanation": "Below are some of the main differences between HTML and React event handling,\n\n1.  In HTML, the event name should be in _lowercase_:\n    \n        <button onclick=\"activateLasers()\"></button>\n        \n    \n    Whereas in React it follows _camelCase_ convention:\n    \n        <button onClick={activateLasers}>\n        \n    \n2.  In HTML, you can return `false` to prevent default behavior:\n    \n        <a\n          href=\"#\"\n          onclick='console.log(\"The link was clicked.\"); return false;'\n        />\n        \n    \n    Whereas in React you must call `preventDefault()` explicitly:\n    \n        function handleClick(event) {\n          event.preventDefault();\n          console.log(\"The link was clicked.\");\n        }\n        \n    \n3.  In HTML, you need to invoke the function by appending `()` Whereas in react you should not append `()` with the function name. (refer \"activateLasers\" function in the first point for example)"

    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks?",
      "explanation": "There are 3 possible ways to achieve this:\n\n1.  **Binding in Constructor:** In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same thing applies for React event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor.\n    \n        class Component extends React.Component {\n          constructor(props) {\n            super(props);\n            this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n          }\n        \n          handleClick() {\n            // ...\n          }\n        }\n        \n    \n2.  **Public class fields syntax:** If you don't like to use bind approach then _public class fields syntax_ can be used to correctly bind callbacks.\n    \n        handleClick = () => {\n          console.log(\"this is:\", this);\n        };\n        \n    \n        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>{\"Click me\"}</button>\n        \n    \n3.  **Arrow functions in callbacks:** You can use _arrow functions_ directly in the callbacks.\n    \n        <button onClick={(event) => this.handleClick(event)}>\n          {\"Click me\"}\n        </button>\n        \n    \n\n**Note:** If the callback is passed as prop to child components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. In those cases, it is preferred to go with `.bind()` or _public class fields syntax_ approach considering performance."
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "How to pass a parameter to an event handler or callback?",
      "explanation": "You can use an _arrow function_ to wrap around an _event handler_ and pass parameters:\n\n    <button onClick={() => this.handleClick(id)} />\n    \n\nThis is an equivalent to calling `.bind`:\n\n    <button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this, id)} />\n    \n\nApart from these two approaches, you can also pass arguments to a function which is defined as arrow function\n\n    <button onClick={this.handleClick(id)} />;\n    handleClick = (id) => () => {\n      console.log(\"Hello, your ticket number is\", id);\n    };"

      "statement": "What are synthetic events in React?",
      "explanation": "`SyntheticEvent` is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. It's API is same as the browser's native event, including `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()`, except the events work identically across all browsers."
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What are inline conditional expressions?",
      "explanation": "You can use either _if statements_ or _ternary expressions_ which are available from JS to conditionally render expressions. Apart from these approaches, you can also embed any expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces and then followed by JS logical operator `&&`.\n\n    <h1>Hello!</h1>;\n    {\n      messages.length > 0 && !isLogin ? (\n        <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.</h2>\n      ) : (\n        <h2>You don't have unread messages.</h2>\n      );\n    }"
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What is \"key\" prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?",
      "explanation": "A `key` is a special string attribute you **should** include when creating arrays of elements. _Key_ prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.\n\nMost often we use ID from our data as _key_:\n\n    const todoItems = todos.map((todo) => <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>);\n    \n\nWhen you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item _index_ as a _key_ as a last resort:\n\n    const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) => (\n      <li key={index}>{todo.text}</li>\n    ));\n    \n\n**Note:**\n\n1.  Using _indexes_ for _keys_ is **not recommended** if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.\n2.  If you extract list item as separate component then apply _keys_ on list component instead of `li` tag.\n3.  There will be a warning message in the console if the `key` prop is not present on list items."

    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What is the use of refs?",
      "explanation": "The _ref_ is used to return a reference to the element. They _should be avoided_ in most cases, however, they can be useful when you need a direct access to the DOM element or an instance of a component."
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "How to create refs?",
      "explanation": "There are two approaches\n\n1.  This is a recently added approach. _Refs_ are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the `ref` attribute. In order to use _refs_ throughout the component, just assign the _ref_ to the instance property within constructor.\n    \n        class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n          constructor(props) {\n            super(props);\n            this.myRef = React.createRef();\n          }\n          render() {\n            return <div ref={this.myRef} />;\n          }\n        }\n        \n    \n2.  You can also use ref callbacks approach regardless of React version. For example, the search bar component's input element accessed as follows,\n    \n        class SearchBar extends Component {\n          constructor(props) {\n            super(props);\n            this.txtSearch = null;\n            this.state = { term: \"\" };\n            this.setInputSearchRef = (e) => {\n              this.txtSearch = e;\n            };\n          }\n          onInputChange(event) {\n            this.setState({ term: this.txtSearch.value });\n          }\n          render() {\n            return (\n              <input\n                value={this.state.term}\n                onChange={this.onInputChange.bind(this)}\n                ref={this.setInputSearchRef}\n              />\n            );\n          }\n        }\n        \n    \n\nYou can also use _refs_ in function components using **closures**. **Note**: You can also use inline ref callbacks even though it is not a recommended approach"

    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "Why are String Refs legacy?",
      "explanation": "If you worked with React before, you might be familiar with an older API where the `ref` attribute is a string, like `ref={'textInput'}`, and the DOM node is accessed as `this.refs.textInput`. We advise against it because _string refs have below issues_, and are considered legacy. String refs were **removed in React v16**.\n\n1.  They _force React to keep track of currently executing component_. This is problematic because it makes react module stateful, and thus causes weird errors when react module is duplicated in the bundle.\n    \n2.  They are _not composable_ — if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can't put another ref on it. Callback refs are perfectly composable.\n    \n3.  They _don't work with static analysis_ like Flow. Flow can't guess the magic that framework does to make the string ref appear on `this.refs`, as well as its type (which could be different). Callback refs are friendlier to static analysis.\n    \n4.  It doesn't work as most people would expect with the \"render callback\" pattern (e.g. )\n    \n        class MyComponent extends Component {\n          renderRow = (index) => {\n            // This won't work. Ref will get attached to DataTable rather than MyComponent:\n            return <input ref={\"input-\" + index} />;\n        \n            // This would work though! Callback refs are awesome.\n            return <input ref={(input) => (this[\"input-\" + index] = input)} />;\n          };\n        \n          render() {\n            return (\n              <DataTable data={this.props.data} renderRow={this.renderRow} />\n            );\n          }\n        }"

      "explanation": "The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases:\n\n1.  **Mounting:** The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from `constructor()`, `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `render()`, and `componentDidMount()` lifecycle methods.\n    \n2.  **Updating:** In this phase, the component get updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from `setState()` or `forceUpdate()`. This phase covers `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `render()`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` and `componentDidUpdate()` lifecycle methods.\n    \n3.  **Unmounting:** In this last phase, the component is not needed and get unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method.\n    \n\nIt's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows\n\n1.  **Render** The component will render without any side-effects. This applies for Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.\n    \n2.  **Pre-commit** Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`.\n    \n3.  **Commit** React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively `componentDidMount()` for mounting, `componentDidUpdate()` for updating, and `componentWillUnmount()` for unmounting.\n    \n\nReact 16.3+ Phases (or an [interactive version](http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/))\n\nBefore React 16.3"

By default it returns `true`. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.\n*   **componentWillUpdate:** Executed before re-rendering the component when there are props & state changes confirmed by `shouldComponentUpdate()` which returns true.\n*   **componentDidUpdate:** Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.\n*   **componentWillUnmount:** It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.\n\nReact 16.3+\n\n*   **getDerivedStateFromProps:** Invoked right before calling `render()` and is invoked on _every_ render. This exists for rare use cases where you need derived state. Worth reading [if you need derived state](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html).\n*   **componentDidMount:** Executed after first rendering and where all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.\n*   **shouldComponentUpdate:** Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default it returns `true`. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.\n*   **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate:** Executed right before rendered output is committed to the DOM. Any value returned by this will be passed into `componentDidUpdate()`. This is useful to capture information from the DOM i.e. scroll position.\n*   **componentDidUpdate:** Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes. This will not fire if `shouldComponentUpdate()` returns `false`.\n*   **componentWillUnmount** It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component."

      "statement": "Why we need to pass a function to setState()?",
      "explanation": "The reason behind for this is that `setState()` is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after `setState()` is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling `setState()` since you can't be sure what that state will be. The solution is to pass a function to `setState()`, with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of `setState()`.\n\nLet's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.\n\n    // assuming this.state.count === 0\n    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\n    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\n    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\n    // this.state.count === 1, not 3\n    \n\nIf we pass a function to `setState()`, the count gets incremented correctly.\n\n    this.setState((prevState, props) => ({\n      count: prevState.count + props.increment,\n    }));\n    // this.state.count === 3 as expected\n    \n\n**(OR)**\n\nReact may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for performance. Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.\n\nThis counter example will fail to update as expected:\n\n    // Wrong\n    this.setState({\n      counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,\n    });\n    \n\nThe preferred approach is to call `setState()` with function rather than object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.\n\n    // Correct\n    this.setState((prevState, props) => ({\n      counter: prevState.counter + props.increment,\n    }));"

Using `isMounted()` is a code smell because the only reason you would check is because you think you might be holding a reference after the component has unmounted.\n\nAn optimal solution would be to find places where `setState()` might be called after a component has unmounted, and fix them. Such situations most commonly occur due to callbacks, when a component is waiting for some data and gets unmounted before the data arrives. Ideally, any callbacks should be canceled in `componentWillUnmount()`, prior to unmounting."

This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state.\n3.  **Changes are made with pure functions:** To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action as parameters, and return the next state."

You can enforce this with dev-only packages like `redux-immutable-state-invariant`, Immutable.js, or instructing your team to write non-mutating code.\n2.  **You're going to have to carefully pick your packages:** While Flux explicitly doesn't try to solve problems such as undo/redo, persistence, or forms, Redux has extension points such as middleware and store enhancers, and it has spawned a rich ecosystem.\n3.  **There is no nice Flow integration yet:** Flux currently lets you do very impressive static type checks which Redux doesn't support yet."

      "statement": "What is the proper way to access Redux store?",
      "explanation": "The best way to access your store in a component is to use the `connect()` function, that creates a new component that wraps around your existing one. This pattern is called _Higher-Order Components_, and is generally the preferred way of extending a component's functionality in React. This allows you to map state and action creators to your component, and have them passed in automatically as your store updates.\n\nLet's take an example of `<FilterLink>` component using connect:\n\n    import { connect } from \"react-redux\";\n    import { setVisibilityFilter } from \"../actions\";\n    import Link from \"../components/Link\";\n    \n    const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({\n      active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter,\n    });\n    \n    const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => ({\n      onClick: () => dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter)),\n    });\n    \n    const FilterLink = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Link);\n    \n    export default FilterLink;\n    \n\nDue to it having quite a few performance optimizations and generally being less likely to cause bugs, the Redux developers almost always recommend using `connect()` over accessing the store directly (using context API).\n\n    class MyComponent {\n      someMethod() {\n        doSomethingWith(this.context.store);\n      }\n    }"

Instead, apply HOCs outside the component definition so that the resulting component is created only once.\n    \n2.  **Static methods must be copied over:** When you apply a HOC to a component the new component does not have any of the static methods of the original component\n    \n        // Define a static method\n        WrappedComponent.staticMethod = function () {\n          /*...*/\n        };\n        // Now apply a HOC\n        const EnhancedComponent = enhance(WrappedComponent);\n        \n        // The enhanced component has no static method\n        typeof EnhancedComponent.staticMethod === \"undefined\"; // true\n        \n    \n    You can overcome this by copying the methods onto the container before returning it,\n    \n        function enhance(WrappedComponent) {\n          class Enhance extends React.Component {\n            /*...*/\n          }\n          // Must know exactly which method(s) to copy :(\n          Enhance.staticMethod = WrappedComponent.staticMethod;\n          return Enhance;\n        }\n        \n    \n3.  **Refs aren’t passed through:** For HOCs you need to pass through all props to the wrapped component but this does not work for refs.

If you add a ref to a HOC, the ref will refer to the outermost container component, not the wrapped component. In this case, you can use Forward Ref API. For example, we can explicitly forward refs to the inner FancyButton component using the React.forwardRef API.\n\nThe below HOC logs all props,\n\n    ```javascript\n    function logProps(Component) {\n      class LogProps extends React.Component {\n        componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\n          console.log('old props:', prevProps);\n          console.log('new props:', this.props);\n        }\n    \n        render() {\n          const {forwardedRef, ...rest} = this.props;\n    \n          // Assign the custom prop \"forwardedRef\" as a ref\n          return <Component ref={forwardedRef} {...rest} />;\n        }\n      }\n    \n      return React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n        return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;\n      });\n    }\n    ```\n    \n\nLet's use this HOC to log all props that get passed to our “fancy button” component,\n\n    ```javascript\n    class FancyButton extends React.Component {\n      focus() {\n        // ...\n      }\n    \n      // ...\n    }\n    export default logProps(FancyButton);\n    ```\n    \n\nNow lets create a ref and pass it to FancyButton component. In this case, you can set focus to button element.\n\n    ```javascript\n    import FancyButton from './FancyButton';\n    \n    const ref = React.createRef();\n    ref.current.focus();\n    <FancyButton\n      label=\"Click Me\"\n      handleClick={handleClick}\n      ref={ref}\n    />;\n    ```"

Whereas for initial state, you have to provide a separate getInitialState method that returns the initial state.\n\n    var Greeting = createReactClass({\n      getDefaultProps: function () {\n        return {\n          name: \"Jhohn\",\n        };\n      },\n      getInitialState: function () {\n        return { message: this.props.message };\n      },\n      handleClick: function () {\n        console.log(this.state.message);\n      },\n      render: function () {\n        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;\n      },\n    });\n    \n\n**Note:** If you use createReactClass then auto binding is available for all methods. i.e, You don't need to use `.bind(this)` with in constructor for event handlers."

However, the algorithms have a complexity in the order of O(n3) where n is the number of elements in the tree.\n\nIn this case, for displaying 1000 elements would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive. Instead, React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:\n\n1.  Two elements of different types will produce different trees.\n2.  The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop."
    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What are the rules covered by diffing algorithm?",
      "explanation": "When diffing two trees, React first compares the two root elements. The behavior is different depending on the types of the root elements. It covers the below rules during reconciliation algorithm,\n\n1.  **Elements Of Different Types:** Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch. For example, elements\n    \n    to of different types lead a full rebuild.\n    \n*   **DOM Elements Of The Same Type:** When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes. Lets take an example with same DOM elements except className attribute,\n    \n        <div className=\"show\" title=\"ReactJS\" />\n        \n        <div className=\"hide\" title=\"ReactJS\" />\n        \n    \n*   **Component Elements Of The Same Type:** When a component updates, the instance stays the same, so that state is maintained across renders. React updates the props of the underlying component instance to match the new element, and calls componentWillReceiveProps() and componentWillUpdate() on the underlying instance. After that, the render() method is called and the diff algorithm recurses on the previous result and the new result.\n    \n*   **Recursing On Children:** when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there’s a difference. For example, when adding an element at the end of the children, converting between these two trees works well.\n    \n        <ul>\n          <li>first</li>\n          <li>second</li>\n        </ul>\n        \n        <ul>\n          <li>first</li>\n          <li>second</li>\n          <li>third</li>\n        </ul>\n        \n        \n    \n*   **Handling keys:** React supports a key attribute. When children have keys, React uses the key to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree. For example, adding a key can make the tree conversion efficient,\n    \n\n<ul>\n      <li key=\"2015\">Duke</li>\n      <li key=\"2016\">Villanova</li>\n    </ul>\n    \n    <ul>\n      <li key=\"2014\">Connecticut</li>\n      <li key=\"2015\">Duke</li>\n      <li key=\"2016\">Villanova</li>\n    </ul>"

Lets take an example with the children prop for render props,\n\n    <Mouse\n      children={(mouse) => (\n        <p>\n          The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}\n        </p>\n      )}\n    />\n    \n\nActually children prop doesn’t need to be named in the list of “attributes” in JSX element. Instead, you can keep it directly inside element,\n\n    <Mouse>\n      {(mouse) => (\n        <p>\n          The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}\n        </p>\n      )}\n    </Mouse>\n    \n\nWhile using this above technique(without any name), explicitly state that children should be a function in your propTypes.\n\n    Mouse.propTypes = {\n      children: PropTypes.func.isRequired,\n    };"

The first item is the current value, and the second is a function that updates the value. Using \\[0\\] and \\[1\\] to access them is a bit confusing because they have a specific meaning. This is why we use array destructuring instead.\n\nFor example, the array index access would look as follows:\n\n    var userStateVariable = useState(\"userProfile\"); // Returns an array pair\n    var user = userStateVariable[0]; // Access first item\n    var setUser = userStateVariable[1]; // Access second item\n    \n\nWhereas with array destructuring the variables can be accessed as follows:\n\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(\"userProfile\");"

      "explanation": "Web Components often expose an imperative API to implement its functions. You will need to use a **ref** to interact with the DOM node directly if you want to access imperative API of a web component. But if you are using third-party Web Components, the best solution is to write a React component that behaves as a **wrapper** for your Web Component."

      "statement": "What is Concurrent Rendering?",
      "explanation": "The Concurrent rendering makes React apps to be more responsive by rendering component trees without blocking the main UI thread. It allows React to interrupt a long-running render to handle a high-priority event. i.e, When you enabled concurrent Mode, React will keep an eye on other tasks that need to be done, and if there's something with a higher priority it will pause what it is currently rendering and let the other task finish first. You can enable this in two ways,\n\n    // 1. Part of an app by wrapping with ConcurrentMode\n    <React.unstable_ConcurrentMode>\n      <Something />\n    </React.unstable_ConcurrentMode>;\n    \n    // 2.

      "explanation": "Imagine a simple UI component, such as a \"Like\" button. When you tap it, it turns blue if it was previously grey, and grey if it was previously blue.\n\nThe imperative way of doing this would be:\n\n    if (user.likes()) {\n      if (hasBlue()) {\n        removeBlue();\n        addGrey();\n      } else {\n        removeGrey();\n        addBlue();\n      }\n    }\n    \n\nBasically, you have to check what is currently on the screen and handle all the changes necessary to redraw it with the current state, including undoing the changes from the previous state. You can imagine how complex this could be in a real-world scenario.\n\nIn contrast, the declarative approach would be:\n\n    if (this.state.liked) {\n      return <blueLike />;\n    } else {\n      return <greyLike />;\n    }\n    \n\nBecause the declarative approach separates concerns, this part of it only needs to handle how the UI should look in a sepecific state, and is therefore much simpler to understand."
