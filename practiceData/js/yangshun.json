      "statement": "Explain event delegation",
      "explanation": "Event delegation is a technique involving adding event listeners to a parent element instead of adding them to the descendant elements. The listener will fire whenever the event is triggered on the descendant elements due to event bubbling up the DOM. The benefits of this technique are:\n\n*   Memory footprint goes down because only one single handler is needed on the parent element, rather than having to attach event handlers on each descendant.\n*   There is no need to unbind the handler from elements that are removed and to bind the event for new elements."

      "statement": "Explain how `this` works in JavaScript",
      "explanation": "There's no simple explanation for `this`; it is one of the most confusing concepts in JavaScript. A hand-wavey explanation is that the value of `this` depends on how the function is called. I have read many explanations on `this` online, and I found [Arnav Aggrawal](https://medium.com/@arnav_aggarwal)'s explanation to be the clearest. The following rules are applied:\n\n1.  If the `new` keyword is used when calling the function, `this` inside the function is a brand new object.\n2.  If `apply`, `call`, or `bind` are used to call/create a function, `this` inside the function is the object that is passed in as the argument.\n3.  If a function is called as a method, such as `obj.method()` — `this` is the object that the function is a property of.\n4.  If a function is invoked as a free function invocation, meaning it was invoked without any of the conditions present above, `this` is the global object. In a browser, it is the `window` object. If in strict mode (`'use strict'`), `this` will be `undefined` instead of the global object.\n5.  If multiple of the above rules apply, the rule that is higher wins and will set the `this` value.\n6.  If the function is an ES2015 arrow function, it ignores all the rules above and receives the `this` value of its surrounding scope at the time it is created.\n\nFor an in-depth explanation, do check out his [article on Medium](https://codeburst.io/the-simple-rules-to-this-in-javascript-35d97f31bde3).\n\n#### Can you give an example of one of the ways that working with this has changed in ES6?\n\nES6 allows you to use [arrow functions](http://2ality.com/2017/12/alternate-this.html#arrow-functions) which uses the [enclosing lexical scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#No_separate_this). This is usually convenient, but does prevent the caller from controlling context via `.call` or `.apply`—the consequences being that a library such as `jQuery` will not properly bind `this` in your event handler functions. Thus, it's important to keep this in mind when refactoring large legacy applications."

      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "Explain how prototypal inheritance works",
      "explanation": "This is an extremely common JavaScript interview question. All JavaScript objects have a `__proto__` property, that is a reference to another object, which is called the object's \"prototype\". When a property is accessed on an object and if the property is not found on that object, the JavaScript engine looks at the object's `__proto__`, and the `__proto__`'s `__proto__` and so on, until it finds the property defined on one of the `__proto__`s or until it reaches the end of the prototype chain. This behavior simulates classical inheritance, but it is really more of [delegation than inheritance](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-objects).\n\n#### Example of Prototypal Inheritance\n\nWe already have a build-in `Object.create`, but if you were to provide a polyfill for it, that might look like:\n\n    if (typeof Object.create !== \"function\") {\n      Object.create = function (parent) {\n        function Tmp() {}\n        Tmp.prototype = parent;\n        return new Tmp();\n      };\n    }\n    \n    const Parent = function () {\n      this.name = \"Parent\";\n    };\n    \n    Parent.prototype.greet = function () {\n      console.log(\"hello from Parent\");\n    };\n    \n    const child = Object.create(Parent.prototype);\n    \n    child.cry = function () {\n      console.log(\"waaaaaahhhh!\");\n    };\n    \n    child.cry();\n    // Outputs: waaaaaahhhh!\n    \n    child.greet();\n    // Outputs: hello from Parent\n    \n\nThings to note are:\n\n*   `.greet` is not defined on the _child_, so the engine goes up the prototype chain and finds `.greet` off the inherited from _Parent_.\n*   We need to call `Object.create` in one of following ways for the prototype methods to be inherited:\n    *   Object.create(Parent.prototype);\n    *   Object.create(new Parent(null));\n    *   Object.create(objLiteral);\n    *   Currently, `child.constructor` is pointing to the `Parent`:\n\n    child.constructor\n    ƒ () {\n      this.name = \"Parent\";\n    }\n    child.constructor.name\n    \"Parent\"\n    \n\n*   If we'd like to correct this, one option would be to do:\n\n    function Child() {\n      Parent.call(this);\n      this.name = \"child\";\n    }\n    \n    Child.prototype = Parent.prototype;\n    Child.prototype.constructor = Child;\n    \n    const c = new Child();\n    \n    c.cry();\n    // Outputs: waaaaaahhhh!\n    \n    c.greet();\n    // Outputs: hello from Parent\n    \n    c.constructor.name;\n    // Outputs: \"Child\""

      "statement": "What do you think of AMD vs CommonJS?",
      "explanation": "Both are ways to implement a module system, which was not natively present in JavaScript until ES2015 came along. CommonJS is synchronous while AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) is obviously asynchronous. CommonJS is designed with server-side development in mind while AMD, with its support for asynchronous loading of modules, is more intended for browsers.\n\nI find AMD syntax to be quite verbose and CommonJS is closer to the style you would write import statements in other languages. Most of the time, I find AMD unnecessary, because if you served all your JavaScript into one concatenated bundle file, you wouldn't benefit from the async loading properties. Also, CommonJS syntax is closer to Node style of writing modules and there is less context-switching overhead when switching between client side and server side JavaScript development.\n\nI'm glad that with ES2015 modules, that has support for both synchronous and asynchronous loading, we can finally just stick to one approach. Although it hasn't been fully rolled out in browsers and in Node, we can always use transpilers to convert our code."

      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE: `function foo(){ }();`. What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE?",
      "explanation": "IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expressions. The JavaScript parser reads `function foo(){ }();` as `function foo(){ }` and `();`, where the former is a _function declaration_ and the latter (a pair of parentheses) is an attempt at calling a function but there is no name specified, hence it throws `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token )`.\n\nHere are two ways to fix it that involves adding more parentheses: `(function foo(){ })()` and `(function foo(){ }())`. Statements that begin with `function` are considered to be _function declarations_; by wrapping this function within `()`, it becomes a _function expression_ which can then be executed with the subsequent `()`. These functions are not exposed in the global scope and you can even omit its name if you do not need to reference itself within the body.\n\nYou might also use `void` operator: `void function foo(){ }();`. Unfortunately, there is one issue with such approach. The evaluation of given expression is always `undefined`, so if your IIFE function returns anything, you can't use it. An example:\n\n    const foo = void (function bar() {\n      return \"foo\";\n    })();\n    \n    console.log(foo); // undefined"

    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What's the difference between a variable that is: `null`, `undefined` or undeclared? How would you go about checking for any of these states?",
      "explanation": "**Undeclared** variables are created when you assign a value to an identifier that is not previously created using `var`, `let` or `const`. Undeclared variables will be defined globally, outside of the current scope. In strict mode, a `ReferenceError` will be thrown when you try to assign to an undeclared variable. Undeclared variables are bad just like how global variables are bad. Avoid them at all cost! To check for them, wrap its usage in a `try`/`catch` block.\n\n    function foo() {\n      x = 1; // Throws a ReferenceError in strict mode\n    }\n    \n    foo();\n    console.log(x); // 1\n    \n\nA variable that is `undefined` is a variable that has been declared, but not assigned a value. It is of type `undefined`. If a function does not return any value as the result of executing it is assigned to a variable, the variable also has the value of `undefined`. To check for it, compare using the strict equality (`===`) operator or `typeof` which will give the `'undefined'` string. Note that you should not be using the abstract equality operator to check, as it will also return `true` if the value is `null`.\n\n    var foo;\n    console.log(foo); // undefined\n    console.log(foo === undefined); // true\n    console.log(typeof foo === \"undefined\"); // true\n    \n    console.log(foo == null); // true. Wrong, don't use this to check!\n    \n    function bar() {}\n    var baz = bar();\n    console.log(baz); // undefined\n    \n\nA variable that is `null` will have been explicitly assigned to the `null` value. It represents no value and is different from `undefined` in the sense that it has been explicitly assigned. To check for `null,` simply compare using the strict equality operator. Note that like the above, you should not be using the abstract equality operator (`==`) to check, as it will also return `true` if the value is `undefined`.\n\n    var foo = null;\n    console.log(foo === null); // true\n    console.log(typeof foo === \"object\"); // true\n    \n    console.log(foo == undefined); // true. Wrong, don't use this to check!\n    \n\nAs a personal habit, I never leave my variables undeclared or unassigned. I will explicitly assign `null` to them after declaring if I don't intend to use it yet. If you use a linter in your workflow, it will usually also be able to check that you are not referencing undeclared variables."

      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?",
      "explanation": "A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. The word \"lexical\" refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available. Closures are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables—scope chain even after the outer function has returned.\n\n**Why would you use one?**\n\n*   Data privacy / emulating private methods with closures. Commonly used in the [module pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript).\n*   [Partial applications or currying](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/curry-or-partial-application-8150044c78b8#.l4b6l1i3x)."

      "explanation": "To understand the differences between the two, let's look at what each function does.\n\n**`forEach`**\n\n*   Iterates through the elements in an array.\n*   Executes a callback for each element.\n*   Does not return a value.\n\n    const a = [1, 2, 3];\n    const doubled = a.forEach((num, index) => {\n      // Do something with num and/or index.\n    });\n    \n    // doubled = undefined\n    \n\n**`map`**\n\n*   Iterates through the elements in an array.\n*   \"Maps\" each element to a new element by calling the function on each element, creating a new array as a result.\n\n    const a = [1, 2, 3];\n    const doubled = a.map((num) => {\n      return num * 2;\n    });\n    \n    // doubled = [2, 4, 6]\n    \n\nThe main difference between `.forEach` and `.map()` is that `.map()` returns a new array. If you need the result, but do not wish to mutate the original array, `.map()` is the clear choice. If you simply need to iterate over an array, `forEach` is a fine choice."

I would represent my app's models using plain objects and write utility pure functions to manipulate these objects. State is manipulated using actions and reducers like in any other Redux application.\n\nI avoid using classical inheritance where possible.

      "explanation": "This question is pretty vague. My best guess at its intention is that it is asking about constructors in JavaScript. Technically speaking, `function Person(){}` is just a normal function declaration. The convention is to use PascalCase for functions that are intended to be used as constructors.\n\n`var person = Person()` invokes the `Person` as a function, and not as a constructor. Invoking as such is a common mistake if the function is intended to be used as a constructor. Typically, the constructor does not return anything, hence invoking the constructor like a normal function will return `undefined` and that gets assigned to the variable intended as the instance.\n\n`var person = new Person()` creates an instance of the `Person` object using the `new` operator, which inherits from `Person.prototype`. An alternative would be to use `Object.create`, such as: `Object.create(Person.prototype)`.\n\n    function Person(name) {\n      this.name = name;\n    }\n    \n    var person = Person(\"John\");\n    console.log(person); // undefined\n    console.log(person.name); // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined\n    \n    var person = new Person(\"John\");\n    console.log(person); // Person { name: \"John\" }\n    console.log(person.name); // \"john\""

      "explanation": "Both `.call` and `.apply` are used to invoke functions and the first parameter will be used as the value of `this` within the function. However, `.call` takes in comma-separated arguments as the next arguments while `.apply` takes in an array of arguments as the next argument. An easy way to remember this is C for `call` and comma-separated and A for `apply` and an array of arguments.\n\n    function add(a, b) {\n      return a + b;\n    }\n    \n    console.log(add.call(null, 1, 2)); // 3\n    console.log(add.apply(null, [1, 2])); // 3"

      "statement": "When would you use `document.write()`?",
      "explanation": "`document.write()` writes a string of text to a document stream opened by `document.open()`. When `document.write()` is executed after the page has loaded, it will call `document.open` which clears the whole document (`<head>` and `<body>` removed!) and replaces the contents with the given parameter value. Hence it is usually considered dangerous and prone to misuse.\n\nThere are some answers online that explain `document.write()` is being used in analytics code or [when you want to include styles that should only work if JavaScript is enabled](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/06/three_javascrip_1.html). It is even being used in HTML5 boilerplate to [load scripts in parallel and preserve execution order](https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate/wiki/Script-Loading-Techniques#documentwrite-script-tag)! However, I suspect those reasons might be outdated and in the modern day, they can be achieved without using `document.write()`. Please do correct me if I'm wrong about this."

      "statement": "What's the difference between feature detection, feature inference, and using the UA string?",
      "explanation": "**Feature Detection**\n\nFeature detection involves working out whether a browser supports a certain block of code, and running different code depending on whether it does (or doesn't), so that the browser can always provide a working experience rather crashing/erroring in some browsers. For example:\n\n    if (\"geolocation\" in navigator) {\n      // Can use navigator.geolocation\n    } else {\n      // Handle lack of feature\n    }\n    \n\n[Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/) is a great library to handle feature detection.\n\n**Feature Inference**\n\nFeature inference checks for a feature just like feature detection, but uses another function because it assumes it will also exist, e.g.:\n\n    if (document.getElementsByTagName) {\n      element = document.getElementById(id);\n    }\n    \n\nThis is not really recommended. Feature detection is more foolproof.\n\n**UA String**\n\nThis is a browser-reported string that allows the network protocol peers to identify the application type, operating system, software vendor or software version of the requesting software user agent. It can be accessed via `navigator.userAgent`. However, the string is tricky to parse and can be spoofed. For example, Chrome reports both as Chrome and Safari. So to detect Safari you have to check for the Safari string and the absence of the Chrome string. Avoid this method."

      "explanation": "Ajax (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for web pages, and by extension web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly use JSON instead of XML, due to the advantages of JSON being native to JavaScript.\n\nThe `XMLHttpRequest` API is frequently used for the asynchronous communication or these days, the `fetch` API."

      "explanation": "**Advantages**\n\n*   Better interactivity. New content from the server can be changed dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.\n*   Reduce connections to the server since scripts and stylesheets only have to be requested once.\n*   State can be maintained on a page. JavaScript variables and DOM state will persist because the main container page was not reloaded.\n*   Basically most of the advantages of an SPA.\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n*   Dynamic webpages are harder to bookmark.\n*   Does not work if JavaScript has been disabled in the browser.\n*   Some webcrawlers do not execute JavaScript and would not see content that has been loaded by JavaScript.\n*   Webpages using Ajax to fetch data will likely have to combine the fetched remote data with client-side templates to update the DOM. For this to happen, JavaScript will have to be parsed and executed on the browser, and low-end mobile devices might struggle with this.\n*   Basically most of the disadvantages of an SPA."

      "explanation": "JSONP (JSON with Padding) is a method commonly used to bypass the cross-domain policies in web browsers because Ajax requests from the current page to a cross-origin domain is not allowed.\n\nJSONP works by making a request to a cross-origin domain via a `<script>` tag and usually with a `callback` query parameter, for example: `https://example.com?callback=printData`. The server will then wrap the data within a function called `printData` and return it to the client.\n\n    <!-- https://mydomain.com -->\n    <script>\n      function printData(data) {\n        console.log(`My name is ${data.name}!`);\n      }\n    </script>\n    \n    <script src=\"https://example.com?callback=printData\"></script>\n    \n\n    // File loaded from https://example.com?callback=printData\n    printData({ name: \"Yang Shun\" });\n    \n\nThe client has to have the `printData` function in its global scope and the function will be executed by the client when the response from the cross-origin domain is received.\n\nJSONP can be unsafe and has some security implications. As JSONP is really JavaScript, it can do everything else JavaScript can do, so you need to trust the provider of the JSONP data.\n\nThese days, [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) is the recommended approach and JSONP is seen as a hack."

      "statement": "Explain \"hoisting\".",
      "explanation": "Hoisting is a term used to explain the behavior of variable declarations in your code. Variables declared or initialized with the `var` keyword will have their declaration \"moved\" up to the top of their module/function-level scope, which we refer to as hoisting. However, only the declaration is hoisted, the assignment (if there is one), will stay where it is.\n\nNote that the declaration is not actually moved - the JavaScript engine parses the declarations during compilation and becomes aware of declarations and their scopes. It is just easier to understand this behavior by visualizing the declarations as being hoisted to the top of their scope. Let's explain with a few examples.\n\n    console.log(foo); // undefined\n    var foo = 1;\n    console.log(foo); // 1\n    \n\nFunction declarations have the body hoisted while the function expressions (written in the form of variable declarations) only has the variable declaration hoisted.\n\n    // Function Declaration\n    console.log(foo); // [Function: foo]\n    foo(); // 'FOOOOO'\n    function foo() {\n      console.log(\"FOOOOO\");\n    }\n    console.log(foo); // [Function: foo]\n    \n    // Function Expression\n    console.log(bar); // undefined\n    bar(); // Uncaught TypeError: bar is not a function\n    var bar = function () {\n      console.log(\"BARRRR\");\n    };\n    console.log(bar); // [Function: bar]\n    \n\nVariables declared via `let` and `const` are hoisted as well. However, unlike `var` and `function`, they are not initialized and accessing them before the declaration will result in a `ReferenceError` exception. The variable is in a \"temporal dead zone\" from the start of the block until the declaration is processed.\n\n    x; // undefined\n    y; // Reference error: y is not defined\n    \n    var x = \"local\";\n    let y = \"local\";"

      "explanation": "Extending a built-in/native JavaScript object means adding properties/functions to its `prototype`. While this may seem like a good idea at first, it is dangerous in practice. Imagine your code uses a few libraries that both extend the `Array.prototype` by adding the same `contains` method, the implementations will overwrite each other and your code will break if the behavior of these two methods is not the same.\n\nThe only time you may want to extend a native object is when you want to create a polyfill, essentially providing your own implementation for a method that is part of the JavaScript specification but might not exist in the user's browser due to it being an older browser."

      "explanation": "The below is taken from the awesome [Grab Front End Guide](https://github.com/grab/front-end-guide), which coincidentally, is written by me!\n\nWeb developers these days refer to the products they build as web apps, rather than websites. While there is no strict difference between the two terms, web apps tend to be highly interactive and dynamic, allowing the user to perform actions and receive a response to their action. Traditionally, the browser receives HTML from the server and renders it. When the user navigates to another URL, a full-page refresh is required and the server sends fresh new HTML to the new page. This is called server-side rendering.\n\nHowever, in modern SPAs, client-side rendering is used instead. The browser loads the initial page from the server, along with the scripts (frameworks, libraries, app code) and stylesheets required for the whole app. When the user navigates to other pages, a page refresh is not triggered. The URL of the page is updated via the [HTML5 History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API). New data required for the new page, usually in JSON format, is retrieved by the browser via [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started) requests to the server. The SPA then dynamically updates the page with the data via JavaScript, which it has already downloaded in the initial page load. This model is similar to how native mobile apps work.\n\nThe benefits:\n\n*   The app feels more responsive and users do not see the flash between page navigations due to full-page refreshes.\n*   Fewer HTTP requests are made to the server, as the same assets do not have to be downloaded again for each page load.\n*   Clear separation of the concerns between the client and the server; you can easily build new clients for different platforms (e.g. mobile, chatbots, smart watches) without having to modify the server code. You can also modify the technology stack on the client and server independently, as long as the API contract is not broken.\n\nThe downsides:\n\n*   Heavier initial page load due to the loading of framework, app code, and assets required for multiple pages.\n*   There's an additional step to be done on your server which is to configure it to route all requests to a single entry point and allow client-side routing to take over from there.\n*   SPAs are reliant on JavaScript to render content, but not all search engines execute JavaScript during crawling, and they may see empty content on your page. This inadvertently hurts the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of your app. However, most of the time, when you are building apps, SEO is not the most important factor, as not all the content needs to be indexable by search engines. To overcome this, you can either server-side render your app or use services such as [Prerender](https://prerender.io/) to \"render your javascript in a browser, save the static HTML, and return that to the crawlers\"."

There's a ramp up cost involved for your team if you use it for your projects.\n*   Smaller community (depends on the language), which means resources, tutorials, libraries, and tooling would be harder to find.\n*   IDE/editor support might be lacking.\n*   These languages will always be behind the latest JavaScript standard.\n*   Developers should be cognizant of what their code is being compiled to — because that is what would actually be running, and that is what matters in the end.\n\nPractically, ES2015 has vastly improved JavaScript and made it much nicer to write.

      "explanation": "For objects:\n\n*   `for-in` loops - `for (var property in obj) { console.log(property); }`. However, this will also iterate through its inherited properties, and you will add an `obj.hasOwnProperty(property)` check before using it.\n*   `Object.keys()` - `Object.keys(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... })`. `Object.keys()` is a static method that will lists all enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.\n*   `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` - `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... })`. `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` is a static method that will lists all enumerable and non-enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.\n\nFor arrays:\n\n*   `for` loops - `for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)`. The common pitfall here is that `var` is in the function scope and not the block scope and most of the time you would want block scoped iterator variable. ES2015 introduces `let` which has block scope and it is recommended to use that instead. So this becomes: `for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)`.\n*   `forEach` - `arr.forEach(function (el, index) { ... })`. This construct can be more convenient at times because you do not have to use the `index` if all you need is the array elements. There are also the `every` and `some` methods which will allow you to terminate the iteration early.\n*   `for-of` loops - `for (let elem of arr) { ... }`. ES6 introduces a new loop, the `for-of` loop, that allows you to loop over objects that conform to the [iterable protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterable_protocol) such as `String`, `Array`, `Map`, `Set`, etc. It combines the advantages of the `for` loop and the `forEach()` method. The advantage of the `for` loop is that you can break from it, and the advantage of `forEach()` is that it is more concise than the `for` loop because you don't need a counter variable. With the `for-of` loop, you get both the ability to break from a loop and a more concise syntax.\n\nMost of the time, I would prefer the `.forEach` method, but it really depends on what you are trying to do. Before ES6, we used `for` loops when we needed to prematurely terminate the loop using `break`. But now with ES6, we can do that with `for-of` loops. I would use `for` loops when I need even more flexibility, such as incrementing the iterator more than once per loop.\n\nAlso, when using the `for-of` loop, if you need to access both the index and value of each array element, you can do so with the ES6 Array `entries()` method and destructuring:\n\n    const arr = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\n    \n    for (let [index, elem] of arr.entries()) {\n      console.log(index, \": \", elem);\n    }"

      "statement": "Explain the difference between mutable and immutable objects.",
      "explanation": "Immutability is a core principle in functional programming, and has lots to offer to object-oriented programs as well. A mutable object is an object whose state can be modified after it is created. An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.\n\n#### What is an example of an immutable object in JavaScript?\n\nIn JavaScript, some built-in types (numbers, strings) are immutable, but custom objects are generally mutable.\n\nSome built-in immutable JavaScript objects are `Math`, `Date`.\n\nHere are a few ways to add/simulate immutability on plain JavaScript objects.\n\n**Object Constant Properties**\n\nBy combining `writable: false` and `configurable: false`, you can essentially create a constant (cannot be changed, redefined or deleted) as an object property, like:\n\n    let myObject = {};\n    Object.defineProperty(myObject, \"number\", {\n      value: 42,\n      writable: false,\n      configurable: false,\n    });\n    console.log(myObject.number); // 42\n    myObject.number = 43;\n    console.log(myObject.number); // 42\n    \n\n**Prevent Extensions**\n\nIf you want to prevent an object from having new properties added to it, but otherwise leave the rest of the object's properties alone, call `Object.preventExtensions(...)`:\n\n    var myObject = {\n      a: 2,\n    };\n    \n    Object.preventExtensions(myObject);\n    \n    myObject.b = 3;\n    myObject.b; // undefined\n    \n\nIn non-strict mode, the creation of `b` fails silently. In strict mode, it throws a `TypeError`.\n\n**Seal**\n\n`Object.seal()` creates a \"sealed\" object, which means it takes an existing object and essentially calls `Object.preventExtensions()` on it, but also marks all its existing properties as `configurable: false`.\n\nSo, not only can you not add any more properties, but you also cannot reconfigure or delete any existing properties (though you can still modify their values).\n\n**Freeze**\n\n`Object.freeze()` creates a frozen object, which means it takes an existing object and essentially calls `Object.seal()` on it, but it also marks all \"data accessor\" properties as writable:false, so that their values cannot be changed.\n\nThis approach is the highest level of immutability that you can attain for an object itself, as it prevents any changes to the object or to any of its direct properties (though, as mentioned above, the contents of any referenced other objects are unaffected).\n\n    var immutable = Object.freeze({});\n    \n\nFreezing an object does not allow new properties to be added to an object and prevents from removing or altering the existing properties. `Object.freeze()` preserves the enumerability, configurability, writability and the prototype of the object. It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.\n\n#### What are the pros and cons of immutability?\n\n**Pros**\n\n*   Easier change detection - Object equality can be determined in a performant and easy manner through referential equality. This is useful for comparing object differences in React and Redux.\n*   Programs with immutable objects are less complicated to think about, since you don't need to worry about how an object may evolve over time.\n*   Defensive copies are no longer necessary when immutable objects are returning from or passed to functions, since there is no possibility an immutable object will be modified by it.\n*   Easy sharing via references - One copy of an object is just as good as another, so you can cache objects or reuse the same object multiple times.\n*   Thread-safe - Immutable objects can be safely used between threads in a multi-threaded environment since there is no risk of them being modified in other concurrently running threads.\n*   Using libraries like ImmmutableJS, objects are modified using structural sharing and less memory is needed for having multiple objects with similar structures.\n\n**Cons**\n\n*   Naive implementations of immutable data structures and its operations can result in extremely poor performance because new objects are created each time. It is recommended to use libraries for efficient immutable data structures and operations that leverage on structural sharing.\n*   Allocation (and deallocation) of many small objects rather than modifying existing ones can cause a performance impact. The complexity of either the allocator or the garbage collector usually depends on the number of objects on the heap.\n*   Cyclic data structures such as graphs are difficult to build. If you have two objects which can't be modified after initialization, how can you get them to point to each other?"

      "explanation": "The main advantage of using an arrow function as a method inside a constructor is that the value of `this` gets set at the time of the function creation and can't change after that. So, when the constructor is used to create a new object, `this` will always refer to that object. For example, let's say we have a `Person` constructor that takes a first name as an argument has two methods to `console.log` that name, one as a regular function and one as an arrow function:\n\n    const Person = function (firstName) {\n      this.firstName = firstName;\n      this.sayName1 = function () {\n        console.log(this.firstName);\n      };\n      this.sayName2 = () => {\n        console.log(this.firstName);\n      };\n    };\n    \n    const john = new Person(\"John\");\n    const dave = new Person(\"Dave\");\n    \n    john.sayName1(); // John\n    john.sayName2(); // John\n    \n    // The regular function can have its 'this' value changed, but the arrow function cannot\n    john.sayName1.call(dave); // Dave (because \"this\" is now the dave object)\n    john.sayName2.call(dave); // John\n    \n    john.sayName1.apply(dave); // Dave (because 'this' is now the dave object)\n    john.sayName2.apply(dave); // John\n    \n    john.sayName1.bind(dave)(); // Dave (because 'this' is now the dave object)\n    john.sayName2.bind(dave)(); // John\n    \n    var sayNameFromWindow1 = john.sayName1;\n    sayNameFromWindow1(); // undefined (because 'this' is now the window object)\n    \n    var sayNameFromWindow2 = john.sayName2;\n    sayNameFromWindow2(); // John\n    \n\nThe main takeaway here is that `this` can be changed for a normal function, but the context always stays the same for an arrow function. So even if you are passing around your arrow function to different parts of your application, you wouldn't have to worry about the context changing.\n\nThis can be particularly helpful in React class components. If you define a class method for something such as a click handler using a normal function, and then you pass that click handler down into a child component as a prop, you will need to also bind `this` in the constructor of the parent component. If you instead use an arrow function, there is no need to also bind \"this\", as the method will automatically get its \"this\" value from its enclosing lexical context.

      "statement": "What is the definition of a higher-order function?",
      "explanation": "A higher-order function is any function that takes one or more functions as arguments, which it uses to operate on some data, and/or returns a function as a result. Higher-order functions are meant to abstract some operation that is performed repeatedly. The classic example of this is `map`, which takes an array and a function as arguments. `map` then uses this function to transform each item in the array, returning a new array with the transformed data. Other popular examples in JavaScript are `forEach`, `filter`, and `reduce`. A higher-order function doesn't just need to be manipulating arrays as there are many use cases for returning a function from another function. `Function.prototype.bind` is one such example in JavaScript.\n\n**Map**\n\nLet say we have an array of names which we need to transform each string to uppercase.\n\n    const names = [\"irish\", \"daisy\", \"anna\"];\n    \n\nThe imperative way will be as such:\n\n    const transformNamesToUppercase = function (names) {\n      const results = [];\n      for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {\n        results.push(names[i].toUpperCase());\n      }\n      return results;\n    };\n    transformNamesToUppercase(names); // ['IRISH', 'DAISY', 'ANNA']\n    \n\nUse `.map(transformerFn)` makes the code shorter and more declarative.\n\n    const transformNamesToUppercase = function (names) {\n      return names.map((name) => name.toUpperCase());\n    };\n    transformNamesToUppercase(names); // ['IRISH', 'DAISY', 'ANNA']"

      "explanation": "Destructuring is an expression available in ES6 which enables a succinct and convenient way to extract values of Objects or Arrays and place them into distinct variables.\n\n**Array destructuring**\n\n    // Variable assignment.\n    const foo = [\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"];\n    \n    const [one, two, three] = foo;\n    console.log(one); // \"one\"\n    console.log(two); // \"two\"\n    console.log(three); // \"three\"\n    \n\n    // Swapping variables\n    let a = 1;\n    let b = 3;\n    \n    [a, b] = [b, a];\n    console.log(a); // 3\n    console.log(b); // 1\n    \n\n**Object destructuring**\n\n    // Variable assignment.\n    const o = { p: 42, q: true };\n    const { p, q } = o;\n    \n    console.log(p); // 42\n    console.log(q); // true"

      "statement": "ES6 Template Literals offer a lot of flexibility in generating strings, can you give an example?",
      "explanation": "Template literals help make it simple to do string interpolation, or to include variables in a string. Before ES2015, it was common to do something like this:\n\n    var person = { name: \"Tyler\", age: 28 };\n    console.log(\n      \"Hi, my name is \" + person.name + \" and I am \" + person.age + \" years old!\"\n    );\n    // 'Hi, my name is Tyler and I am 28 years old!'\n    \n\nWith template literals, you can now create that same output like this instead:\n\n    const person = { name: \"Tyler\", age: 28 };\n    console.log(`Hi, my name is ${person.name} and I am ${person.age} years old!`);\n    // 'Hi, my name is Tyler and I am 28 years old!'\n    \n\nNote that you use backticks, not quotes, to indicate that you are using a template literal and that you can insert expressions inside the `${}` placeholders.\n\nA second helpful use case is in creating multi-line strings. Before ES2015, you could create a multi-line string like this:\n\n    console.log(\"This is line one.\\nThis is line two.\");\n    // This is line one.\n    // This is line two.\n    \n\nOr if you wanted to break it up into multiple lines in your code so you didn't have to scroll to the right in your text editor to read a long string, you could also write it like this:\n\n    console.log(\"This is line one.\\n\" + \"This is line two.\");\n    // This is line one.\n    // This is line two.\n    \n\nTemplate literals, however, preserve whatever spacing you add to them. For example, to create that same multi-line output that we created above, you can simply do:\n\n    console.log(`This is line one.\n    This is line two.`);\n    // This is line one.\n    // This is line two.\n    \n\nAnother use case of template literals would be to use as a substitute for templating libraries for simple variable interpolations:\n\n    const person = { name: \"Tyler\", age: 28 };\n    document.body.innerHTML = `\n      <div>\n        <p>Name: ${person.name}</p>\n        <p>Name: ${person.age}</p>\n      </div>\n    `;\n    \n\n**Note that your code may be susceptible to XSS by using `.innerHTML`.

      "explanation": "Currying is a pattern where a function with more than one parameter is broken into multiple functions that, when called in series, will accumulate all of the required parameters one at a time. This technique can be useful for making code written in a functional style easier to read and compose. It's important to note that for a function to be curried, it needs to start out as one function, then broken out into a sequence of functions that each accepts one parameter.\n\n    function curry(fn) {\n      if (fn.length === 0) {\n        return fn;\n      }\n    \n      function _curried(depth, args) {\n        return function (newArgument) {\n          if (depth - 1 === 0) {\n            return fn(...args, newArgument);\n          }\n          return _curried(depth - 1, [...args, newArgument]);\n        };\n      }\n    \n      return _curried(fn.length, []);\n    }\n    \n    function add(a, b) {\n      return a + b;\n    }\n    \n    var curriedAdd = curry(add);\n    var addFive = curriedAdd(5);\n    \n    var result = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(addFive); // [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]"

      "explanation": "ES6's spread syntax is very useful when coding in a functional paradigm as we can easily create copies of arrays or objects without resorting to `Object.create`, `slice`, or a library function. This language feature is used often in Redux and RxJS projects.\n\n    function putDookieInAnyArray(arr) {\n      return [...arr, \"dookie\"];\n    }\n    \n    const result = putDookieInAnyArray([\"I\", \"really\", \"don't\", \"like\"]); // [\"I\", \"really\", \"don't\", \"like\", \"dookie\"]\n    \n    const person = {\n      name: \"Todd\",\n      age: 29,\n    };\n    \n    const copyOfTodd = { ...person };\n    \n\nES6's rest syntax offers a shorthand for including an arbitrary number of arguments to be passed to a function. It is like an inverse of the spread syntax, taking data and stuffing it into an array rather than unpacking an array of data, and it works in function arguments, as well as in array and object destructuring assignments.\n\n    function addFiveToABunchOfNumbers(...numbers) {\n      return numbers.map((x) => x + 5);\n    }\n    \n    const result = addFiveToABunchOfNumbers(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10); // [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]\n    \n    const [a, b, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // a: 1, b: 2, rest: [3, 4]\n    \n    const { e, f, ...others } = {\n      e: 1,\n      f: 2,\n      g: 3,\n      h: 4,\n    }; // e: 1, f: 2, others: { g: 3, h: 4 }"

      "explanation": "This depends on the JavaScript environment.\n\nOn the client (browser environment), as long as the variables/functions are declared in the global scope (`window`), all scripts can refer to them. Alternatively, adopt the Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) via RequireJS for a more modular approach.\n\nOn the server (Node.js), the common way has been to use CommonJS. Each file is treated as a module and it can export variables and functions by attaching them to the `module.exports` object.\n\nES2015 defines a module syntax which aims to replace both AMD and CommonJS.
