      "statement": "What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript",
      "explanation": "There are many ways to create objects in javascript as below\n\n1.  **Object constructor:**\n    \n    The simplest way to create an empty object is using the Object constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.\n    \n        var object = new Object();\n        \n    \n2.  **Object's create method:**\n    \n    The create method of Object creates a new object by passing the prototype object as a parameter\n    \n        var object = Object.create(null);\n        \n    \n3.  **Object literal syntax:**\n    \n    The object literal syntax is equivalent to create method when it passes null as parameter\n    \n        var object = {};\n        \n    \n4.  **Function constructor:**\n    \n    Create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances,\n    \n        function Person(name) {\n          var object = {};\n          object.name = name;\n          object.age = 21;\n          return object;\n        }\n        var object = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\n        \n    \n5.  **Function constructor with prototype:**\n    \n    This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods,\n    \n        function Person() {}\n        Person.prototype.name = \"Sudheer\";\n        var object = new Person();\n        \n    \n    This is equivalent to an instance created with an object create method with a function prototype and then call that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.\n    \n        function func {};\n        \n        new func(x, y, z);\n        \n    \n    **(OR)**\n    \n        // Create a new instance using function prototype.\n        var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype)\n        \n        // Call the function\n        var result = func.call(newInstance, x, y, z),\n        \n        // If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.\n        console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);\n        \n    \n6.  **ES6 Class syntax:**\n    \n    ES6 introduces class feature to create the objects\n    \n        class Person {\n          constructor(name) {\n            this.name = name;\n          }\n        }\n        \n        var object = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\n        \n    \n7.  **Singleton pattern:**\n    \n    A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance and this way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.\n    \n        var object = new (function () {\n          this.name = \"Sudheer\";\n        })();"

      "statement": "What is a prototype chain",
      "explanation": "**Prototype chaining** is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language. The prototype on object instance is available through **Object.getPrototypeOf(object)** or **proto** property whereas prototype on constructors function is available through object.prototype."

      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind",
      "explanation": "The difference between Call, Apply and Bind can be explained with below examples,\n\n**Call:** The call() method invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided one by one\n\n    var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n    var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n    \n    function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n      console.log(\n        greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n      );\n    }\n    \n    invite.call(employee1, \"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n    invite.call(employee2, \"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n    \n\n**Apply:** Invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments as an array\n\n    var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n    var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n    \n    function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n      console.log(\n        greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n      );\n    }\n    \n    invite.apply(employee1, [\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n    invite.apply(employee2, [\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n    \n\n**bind:** returns a new function, allowing you to pass in an array and any number of arguments\n\n    var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n    var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n    \n    function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n      console.log(\n        greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n      );\n    }\n    \n    var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);\n    var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);\n    inviteEmployee1(\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n    inviteEmployee2(\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n    \n\nCall and apply are pretty interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. You need to decide whether it’s easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember by treating Call is for comma (separated list) and Apply is for Array. Whereas Bind creates a new function that will have `this` set to the first parameter passed to bind()."

      "explanation": "**JSON** is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by `Douglas Crockford`. It is useful when you want to transmit data across a network and it is basically just a text file with an extension of .json, and a MIME type of application/json **Parsing:** Converting a string to a native object\n\n    JSON.parse(text);\n    \n\nStringification: \\*\\*converting a native object to a string so it can be transmitted across the network\n\n    JSON.stringify(object);"

      "explanation": "The **slice()** method returns the selected elements in an array as a new array object. It selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends at the given optional end argument without including the last element. If you omit the second argument then it selects till the end.

      "statement": "What is the purpose of the array splice method",
      "explanation": "The **splice()** method is used either adds/removes items to/from an array, and then returns the removed item. The first argument specifies the array position for insertion or deletion whereas the option second argument indicates the number of elements to be deleted. Each additional argument is added to the array. Some of the examples of this method are,\n\n    let arrayIntegersOriginal1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n    let arrayIntegersOriginal2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n    let arrayIntegersOriginal3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n    \n    let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegersOriginal1.splice(0, 2); // returns [1, 2]; original array: [3, 4, 5]\n    let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegersOriginal2.splice(3); // returns [4, 5]; original array: [1, 2, 3]\n    let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegersOriginal3.splice(3, 1, \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"); //returns [4]; original array: [1, 2, 3, \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", 5]\n    \n\n**Note:** Splice method modifies the original array and returns the deleted array."

    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "How do you compare Object and Map",
      "explanation": "**Objects** are similar to **Maps** in that both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. Due to this reason, Objects have been used as Maps historically. But there are important differences that make using a Map preferable in certain cases.\n\n1.  The keys of an Object are Strings and Symbols, whereas they can be any value for a Map, including functions, objects, and any primitive.\n2.  The keys in Map are ordered while keys added to Object are not. Thus, when iterating over it, a Map object returns keys in order of insertion.\n3.  You can get the size of a Map easily with the size property, while the number of properties in an Object must be determined manually.\n4.  A Map is an iterable and can thus be directly iterated, whereas iterating over an Object requires obtaining its keys in some fashion and iterating over them.\n5.  An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in the map that could collide with your keys if you're not careful. As of ES5 this can be bypassed by using map = Object.create(null), but this is seldom done.\n6.  A Map may perform better in scenarios involving frequent addition and removal of key pairs."

      "statement": "What is the difference between == and === operators",
      "explanation": "JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,\n\n1.  Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.\n2.  Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal. i.e, Having the same number value. There are two special cases in this,\n    1.  NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.\n    2.  Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.\n3.  Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.\n4.  Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.\n5.  Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with ==. i.e, null===undefined --> false but null==undefined --> true\n\nSome of the example which covers the above cases,\n\n    0 == false   // true\n    0 === false  // false\n    1 == \"1\"     // true\n    1 === \"1\"    // false\n    null == undefined // true\n    null === undefined // false\n    '0' == false // true\n    '0' === false // false\n    []==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory\n    {}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory"

      "statement": "What is a first class function",
      "explanation": "In Javascript, functions are first class objects. First-class functions means when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.\n\nFor example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable. For example, in the below example, handler functions assigned to a listener\n\n    const handler = () => console.log(\"This is a click handler function\");\n    document.addEventListener(\"click\", handler);"

      "explanation": "Currying is the process of taking a function with multiple arguments and turning it into a sequence of functions each with only a single argument. Currying is named after a mathematician Haskell Curry. By applying currying, a n-ary function turns it into a unary function. Let's take an example of n-ary function and how it turns into a currying function\n\n    const multiArgFunction = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;\n    const curryUnaryFunction = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;\n    curryUnaryFunction(1); // returns a function: b => c =>  1 + b + c\n    curryUnaryFunction(1)(2); // returns a function: c => 3 + c\n    curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)(3); // returns the number 6\n    \n\nCurried functions are great to improve code reusability and functional composition."

      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What is a pure function",
      "explanation": "A **Pure function** is a function where the return value is only determined by its arguments without any side effects. i.e, If you call a function with the same arguments 'n' number of times and 'n' number of places in the application then it will always return the same value. Let's take an example to see the difference between pure and impure functions,\n\n    //Impure\n    let numberArray = [];\n    const impureAddNumber = (number) => numberArray.push(number);\n    //Pure\n    const pureAddNumber = (number) => (argNumberArray) =>\n      argNumberArray.concat([number]);\n    \n    //Display the results\n    console.log(impureAddNumber(6)); // returns 1\n    console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]\n    console.log(pureAddNumber(7)(numberArray)); // returns [6, 7]\n    console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]\n    \n\nAs per above code snippets, Push function is impure itself by altering the array and returning an push number index which is independent of parameter value. Whereas Concat on the other hand takes the array and concatenates it with the other array producing a whole new array without side effects. Also, the return value is a concatenation of the previous array. Remember that Pure functions are important as they simplify unit testing without any side effects and no need for dependency injection. They also avoid tight coupling and make it harder to break your application by not having any side effects. These principles are coming together with **Immutability** concept of ES6 by giving preference to **const** over **let** usage."

      "explanation": "The `let` statement declares a **block scope local variable**. Hence the variables defined with let keyword are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. Whereas variables declared with the var keyword used to define a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope. Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage,\n\n    let counter = 30;\n    if (counter === 30) {\n      let counter = 31;\n      console.log(counter); // 31\n    }\n    console.log(counter); // 30 (because if block variable won't exist here)"

      "statement": "How do you redeclare variables in switch block without an error",
      "explanation": "If you try to redeclare variables in a `switch block` then it will cause errors because there is only one block. For example, the below code block throws a syntax error as below,\n\n    let counter = 1;\n    switch (x) {\n      case 0:\n        let name;\n        break;\n    \n      case 1:\n        let name; // SyntaxError for redeclaration.\n        break;\n    }\n    \n\nTo avoid this error, you can create a nested block inside a case clause and create a new block scoped lexical environment.\n\n    let counter = 1;\n    switch (x) {\n      case 0: {\n        let name;\n        break;\n      }\n      case 1: {\n        let name; // No SyntaxError for redeclaration.\n        break;\n      }\n    }"

      "explanation": "The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span when that happens, between the creation of a variable’s binding and its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone. Let's see this behavior with an example,\n\n    function somemethod() {\n      console.log(counter1); // undefined\n      console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError\n      var counter1 = 1;\n      let counter2 = 2;\n    }"

Due to that, you can create the same function in two different function expressions to act as a namespace.\n\n    (function () {\n      function fun1() {\n        console.log(\"This is a first definition\");\n      }\n      fun1();\n    })();\n    \n    (function () {\n      function fun1() {\n        console.log(\"This is a second definition\");\n      }\n      fun1();\n    })();\n    \n\n1.  **Using a block and a let/const declaration:** In ECMAScript 6, you can simply use a block and a let declaration to restrict the scope of a variable to a block.\n\n    {\n      let myFunction = function fun1() {\n        console.log(\"This is a first definition\");\n      };\n      myFunction();\n    }\n    //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.\n    \n    {\n      let myFunction = function fun1() {\n        console.log(\"This is a second definition\");\n      };\n      myFunction();\n    }\n    //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined."

Since the variable i is declared with the `var` keyword it became a global variable and the value was equal to 4 using iteration when the time setTimeout function is invoked. Hence, the output of the first loop is `4 4 4 4`. Whereas in the second loop, the variable i is declared as the `let` keyword it becomes a block scoped variable and it holds a new value(0, 1 ,2 3) for each iteration.

A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.\n\n**Example**\n\n    var empDetails = {\n      name: \"John\",\n      age: 25,\n      expertise: \"Software Developer\",\n    };\n    \n\nto create a duplicate\n\n    var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; //Shallow copying!\n    \n\nif we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:\n\n    empDetailsShallowCopy.name = \"Johnson\";\n    \n\nThe above statement will also change the name of `empDetails`, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're losing the original data as well.\n\n**Deep copy:** A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.\n\n**Example**\n\n    var empDetails = {\n      name: \"John\",\n      age: 25,\n      expertise: \"Software Developer\",\n    };\n    \n\nCreate a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variable\n\n    var empDetailsDeepCopy = {\n      name: empDetails.name,\n      age: empDetails.age,\n      expertise: empDetails.expertise,\n    };\n    \n\nNow if you change `empDetailsDeepCopy.name`, it will only affect `empDetailsDeepCopy` & not `empDetails`"

You can write `done` block as below,\n    \n        getDataFromHttp()\n          .then(function (result) {\n            return processDataAsync(result);\n          })\n          .done(function (processed) {\n            displayData(processed);\n          });\n        \n    \n    In future, if the processing library API changed to synchronous then you can remove `done` block as below,\n    \n        getDataFromHttp().then(function (result) {\n          return displayData(processDataAsync(result));\n        });\n        \n    \n    and then you forgot to add `done` block to `then` block leads to silent errors.\n    \n3.  **Extend ES6 Promises by Bluebird:** Bluebird extends the ES6 Promises API to avoid the issue in the second solution. This library has a “default” onRejection handler which will print all errors from rejected Promises to stderr. After installation, you can process unhandled rejections\n    \n        Promise.onPossiblyUnhandledRejection(function (error) {\n          throw error;\n        });\n        \n    \n    and discard a rejection, just handle it with an empty catch\n    \n        Promise.reject(\"error value\").catch(function () {});"

      "statement": "What is a Proper Tail Call",
      "explanation": "First, we should know about tail call before talking about \"Proper Tail Call\". A tail call is a subroutine or function call performed as the final action of a calling function. Whereas **Proper tail call(PTC)** is a technique where the program or code will not create additional stack frames for a recursion when the function call is a tail call.\n\nFor example, the below classic or head recursion of factorial function relies on stack for each step. Each step need to be processed upto `n * factorial(n - 1)`\n\n    function factorial(n) {\n      if (n === 0) {\n        return 1;\n      }\n      return n * factorial(n - 1);\n    }\n    console.log(factorial(5)); //120\n    \n\nBut if you use Tail recursion functions, they keep passing all the necessary data it needs down the recursion without relying on the stack.\n\n    function factorial(n, acc = 1) {\n      if (n === 0) {\n        return acc;\n      }\n      return factorial(n - 1, n * acc);\n    }\n    console.log(factorial(5)); //120\n    \n\nThe above pattern returns the same output as the first one. But the accumulator keeps track of total as an argument without using stack memory on recursive calls."
