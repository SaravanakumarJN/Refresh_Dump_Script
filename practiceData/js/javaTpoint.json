    },
    {
      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "Define anonymous function",
      "explanation": "It is a function that has no name. These functions are declared dynamically at runtime using the function operator instead of the function declaration. The function operator is more flexible than a function declaration. It can be easily used in the place of an expression. For example:\n\n    var display=function()\n    {\n      alert(\"Anonymous Function is invoked\");\n    }\n    display();"

      "statement": "If we want to return the character from a specific index which method is used?",
      "explanation": "The JavaScript string charAt() method is used to find out a char value present at the specified index. The index number starts from 0 and goes to n-1, where n is the length of the string. The index value can't be a negative, greater than or equal to the length of the string. For example:\n\n    var str=\"Javatpoint\";  \n    document.writeln(str.charAt(4));"

      "statement": "What is the use of a TypedArray object in JavaScript?",
      "explanation": "The JavaScript TypedArray object illustrates an array like a view of an underlying binary data buffer. There is any number of different global properties, whose values are TypedArray constructors for specific element types.\n\n     function display()\n    {\n    var arr1= [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];   \n           arr1.copyWithin(2) ; \n           document.write(arr1);  \n    }\n    display();"

      "statement": "What is the use of a Set object in JavaScript?",
      "explanation": "The JavaScript Set object is used to store the elements with unique values. The values can be of any type i.e. whether primitive values or object references. For example:\n\n     function display()\n    {\n    var set = new Set();  \n    set.add(\"jQuery\");  \n    set.add(\"AngularJS\");  \n    set.add(\"Bootstrap\");  \n    for (let elements of set) {  \n     document.writeln(elements+\"<br>\");  \n    }   \n    }\n    display();"

      "statement": "What is the use of a WeakSet object in JavaScript?",
      "explanation": "The JavaScript WeakSet object is the type of collection that allows us to store weakly held objects. Unlike Set, the WeakSet are the collections of objects only. It doesn't contain the arbitrary values. For example:\n\n     function display()\n    {\n    var ws = new WeakSet();  \n    var obj1={};  \n    var obj2={};  \n    ws.add(obj1);  \n    ws.add(obj2);  \n    //Let's check whether the WeakSet object contains the added object  \n    document.writeln(ws.has(obj1)+\"<br>\");  \n    document.writeln(ws.has(obj2));   \n    }   \n    display()"

      "statement": "What is the use of a Map object in JavaScript?",
      "explanation": "The JavaScript Map object is used to map keys to values. It stores each element as key-value pair. It operates the elements such as search, update and delete on the basis of specified key. For example:\n\n     function display()\n    {\n    var map=new Map();  \n    map.set(1,\"jQuery\");  \n    map.set(2,\"AngularJS\");  \n    map.set(3,\"Bootstrap\");  \n    document.writeln(map.get(1)+\"<br>\");  \n    document.writeln(map.get(2)+\"<br>\");  \n    document.writeln(map.get(3));  \n    }\n    display();"

      "type": "LONG",
      "statement": "What is the use of a WeakMap object in JavaScript?",
      "explanation": "The JavaScript WeakMap object is a type of collection which is almost similar to Map. It stores each element as a key-value pair where keys are weakly referenced. Here, the keys are objects and the values are arbitrary values. For example:\n\n     function display()\n    {\n    var wm = new WeakMap();  \n    var obj1 = {};  \n    var obj2 = {};  \n    var obj3= {};  \n    wm.set(obj1, \"jQuery\");  \n    wm.set(obj2, \"AngularJS\");  \n    wm.set(obj3,\"Bootstrap\");  \n    document.writeln(wm.has(obj2));   \n    }   \n    display();"
